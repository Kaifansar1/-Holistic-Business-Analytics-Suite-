Holistic-Business-Analytics-Suite
This project involved creating a Power BI dashboard for Atliq Hardware to replace inefficient Excel-based analytics. The dashboard delivers clear insights into finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, enabling better decision-making. Using SQL, Power BI, and DAX, it improves data analysis and supports Atliq’s continued growth.

Atliq Hardware, a global leader in consumer electronics, is rapidly expanding. However, their reliance on Excel files for data analytics has proven inefficient, leading to suboptimal insights. To overcome these challenges, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, providing streamlined data analysis and enabling data-driven decision-making.

Key Insights The project breaks down complex business data into five user-friendly views:

Finance View Presents key KPIs and components of the Profit & Loss (P&L) Statement. Identifies top-performing and underperforming products and customers across P&L elements.

Sales & Marketing View Provides an in-depth analysis of customer and product performance. Highlights critical metrics like Net Sales, Gross Margin, unit economics, and marketing trends.

Supply Chain View Focuses on metrics such as forecast accuracy, Net Error, and ABS Error. Analyzes risk factors for customers and products, trends in Net Error, and forecast precision.

Executive View Tailored for senior leadership, offering a high-level snapshot of essential business metrics. Includes data on subzones, AtliQ market share, top customers and products by revenue, and a revenue breakdown by divisions and channels.
